My repos are projects at various stages in the lifecycle, and mostly incomplete.  If you're a prospective employer interested in projects that exhibit a reasonable degree of engineering standards, you might look at:

- [C++ Parquet](https://github.com/nealsid/cpp-parquet) - A C++ library for writing Parquet files.
- [Croptastic](https://github.com/nealsid/croptastic) - A JavaScript library to provide an image-cropping U.I.  There are no unit tests, but I paid attention to documentation, comments, and manual testing.
- [Linked List](https://github.com/nealsid/linked-list) - Some experiments in multithreaded linked list code with performance measurement infrastructure.

Some "passion projects" where I was more interested in learning something new are:

- [RayTracer](https://github.com/nealsid/raytracer) - A ray tracer & Wavefront .OBJ loader written in Swift
- [Buggeroo](https://github.com/nealsid/buggeroo) - A debugger written in Java that uses JDI
- [Emacs Junk for Java](https://github.com/nealsid/ejj/blob/master/ejj.el) - Some elisp code for helping to write Java

Additionally, I'm an LLDB contributor with several patches submitted in 2021.
