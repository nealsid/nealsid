My repos are projects at various stages in the lifecycle, and mostly incomplete.  If you're a prospective employer interested in projects that exhibit a reasonable degree of engineering standards, you might look at:

- [C++ Parquet](https://github.com/nealsid/cpp-parquet) - A C++ library for writing Parquet files.
- [Croptastic](https://github.com/nealsid/croptastic) - A JavaScript library to provide an image-cropping U.I.  There are no unit tests, but I paid attention to documentation, comments, and manual testing.
- [Linked List](https://github.com/nealsid/linked-list) - Some experiments in multithreaded & lock-free linked list code with performance measurement infrastructure.

Most recently (June, 2025) I've been contributing bug fixes to several Rust-related projects.  Additionally, I've made (smallish) open-source contributions to LLDB, Emacs, and the Linux Kernel.

Unfortunately (it's necessary to mention due to how public it is!), I have a very public criminal history, due to mental illness at the time, which I am in remission from today.
